                <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                <p>Hi! I'm Megan and I'm currently studying computer software engineering at Fullstack Academy of Code in NYC.</p>

                <p>I first fell in love with coding during my undergraduate studies at NYU, where I minored in Web Programming and Applications. After graduating in 2017, I began working at BounceX, a marketing technology company, as a product integrity analyst and manager. In my position as a product integrity manager, I worked very closely with the product engineering team to help scope new features and products, as well as to identify technical issues with current features and products.</p>
                            
                <p>Upon completion of the Fullstack Academy program, I'm looking to join a collaborative product development team, where I can use my technical skills to solve problems and continue learning from my peers.</p>
