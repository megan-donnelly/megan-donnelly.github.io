        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

        <p>
          Hi! I'm Megan and I'm a full-stack software engineer and web developer
          based in NYC with a background in marketing and quality assurance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I first fell in love with coding during my undergraduate studies at
          NYU, where I minored in Web Programming and Applications. To continue
          to pursue my passion for tech after graduation, I got a job in quality
          assurance at a marketing tech company, where I got exposure into what
          it’s like being a part of an agile team in a product development
          organization. In my role, I collaborated with product owners and
          software engineers to create user story acceptance criteria, wrote and
          executed tests to verify new and existing product features, and
          developed trainings and product documentation for internal and
          external use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although I enjoyed my job, I found that I wanted to be more involved
          with the creation of the code that brought the product to life.
          Outside of work, I began to brush up on my coding skills by building
          small applications, until I felt ready to take the leap to pursue a
          career in software engineering full-time at Fullstack Academy. I'm
          currently working as a Software Engineering Teaching Fellow at The
          Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. Upon completion of the
          fellowship, I'm looking to join a collaborative product development
          team, where I can use my technical skills to solve problems and
          continue learning from my peers.

              <h3>SoleMate</h3>
              <p>
                SoleMate is a fitness based social media app that leverages
                geolocation technology to match users with runners in their
                area. Users are able to message and request runs with people
                they've matched with, generate customized routes, and track
                running info in real-time. When users aren't on the app,
                SoleMate alerts them to incoming requests and messages via push
                notifications.
              </p>
